# analysis-and-design
my analysis and design class portfolio
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
I was building an advising assistant programthat loads course data and sorts them alphabeticly and displays the details and prerequsates for each
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I selected the data structures used based on what was needed for performance requirements like fast lookup speeds and reliable sorted products. These are important to understand because they can be used in everyday life to fit plans into time constraints and in other projects for just learning how to find a solution that fits within parameters.
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I overcame roadblocks by taking a step back to clear my mind, then I came back and looked again. If I still couldn't find anything, I got my father to help look at it because a fresh pair of eyes could help me see problems that I may have totally overlooked.
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
The work on this project has taught me just how useful sorting intentions is before putting in the work using pseudo code and using a binary sorting tree to store values can also be extremely handy when im next creating an application. This project has also taught me to work with requirements and with the constraints of each method because no method is going to be perfect for every situation.
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I've learned just how useful comments can be to keep programs maintainable, but I've also learned how to organize my code better, and I'm actively cleaning up my coding in other personal projects im working on as well, with the knowledge I've gained from this class, including naming schemes, code organization, and making basic documentation for my code.
